    "- **Weather station may not be representative of entire city:** Especially with measurements like days with fog, which is a spotty phenomenon, you could be living somewhere around a city, but just not close enough to the weather station to see what they report.  For example, in Cleveland, if you live a few miles from Lake Erie, you will be much less likely to see fog than the weather station close to Lake Erie.  \n",
    "- Also, in an ideal world, I would attempt to take measurements from several weather stations and aggregate them somehow to be more representative of a general area.  Although, since there are quite a few small towns with relatively sparse data available, I'm not so sure that would be smart.\n",
    "- **Sample size:** I am only sampling 2011-2021 here, 11 years.  I wish I could sample back into the 70's or so, but there are too many fragmented datasets to pick a larger range, so 11 years of data will have to do.  If I am curious about comparing a few cities furthere, I may use Global Summary of the Month (**GSOM**) data to look further.\n",
    "- **You may be tempted to say a city on here is \"high\" or \"low\" compared to others,** however, this dataset was hand-selected and is skewed towards notoriously rainy places, so it wouldn't really be honest to say \"Lafayette gets low rain\" because it is only being compared to the upper echelon of rainy places in the USA."
